# Eurorack-pcbs
A collection of easy to solder DIY eurorack PCB's. All IC's are SOIC or DIP, passives are 1206 or THT for ease of soldering. There are also faceplate drill templates and graphics that can be used for toner transfer. 

# General Notes
Pots and jacks aren't included in any digikey or mouser carts. You want these ones if you're in the US:

https://modularaddict.com/parts/jacks/pj301m12-jacks
Or similar from Thonk if you're in Europe.

Switches can be hard to find. I've had a great experience with taiway switches from these people:

Plus they have switches with adorable short levers. PCB's will accomodate "PCB mount" or "solder lug" style. 

Faceplates: 2mm aluminum works perfectly. Regular drill bits will work, and you can cut it with woodworking tools if you're super careful. If you can't get ahold of that, go to a hobby or art store and get some 1/8" aircraft birch ply. It's thin but very strong. I have been using toner transfer to print graphics and labelling onto the panels. It works for aluminum or wood and results in a distressed look that I kinda like. You can find a tutorial at instuctables (https://www.instructables.com/id/Transfer-PHOTOS-to-METAL/) but here's the bullet points: 
1) Buy *water* based poly from the wood finish section of a hardware store. Paint a thin layer on the faceplate. 
2) Print out your design on a laser printer in reverse and stick it on the *wet* poly. 
3) Let it dry. I stick it in a warm oven to speed up the process.
4) Wet the paper, and gently rub it off. You don't need to get it all in 1 shot. You should repeat the drying and wetting/rubbing cycle 2 or 3 times to get the paper off without removing too much toner.
5) Hit it with another layer of poly for protection. 

# Dual log/lin VCA: 
Design: Ray Wilson (please visit http://musicfromouterspace.com/)
Design alterations: None
Tested working 2019-02
Required kludges: None!
Notes: Also none, this one is super easy and goes together in less than an hour. It's a 2 board pannelized design. Make sure your PCB fab house can handle internal slots for the switch footprint and pannelization. (oshpark and aisler did it without issue.) I may revise this to a one board design in the future to reduce PCB costs. 

# VCO: 
Design: Ray Wilson (please visit http://musicfromouterspace.com/)
Design alterations: None
Tested working 2019-02
Required kludges: 
    V1.0 outer potentiometer leads are reversed and need to be jumpered (X style) to the correct holes.
    V1.0 Silk showing polarity for C12 is reversed (+ side of C12 should be at GND).
    V1.0 Eurorack pwr connector interferes with pot feet on front of board. Simply bend one of the pot feet out of the way so it doesn't       contact the -12V side of the pwr connector.
Notes: U2 is really far away from U4. Use lots of flux and make sure that U1, U3, and U2 U4 are soldered really nicely, otherwise it won't work. U5 has several pins that are not connected (specifically 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16). Depending on the PCB fab you use, they might instantly delaminate. Don't freak out, it's not a problem. 

# Mixer: 
Design: I guess this one is my own, but heavily influenced by information from Ray Wilson (please visit http://musicfromouterspace.com/)
Tested working 2019-02 (breadboard only)
Required kludges: N/A
Notes: PCB layout is incomplete as of 2019-02. This is a DC coupled (CV capable) 4 into 2 or 8 into 1 mixer. It's based off of Ray's mixers, but is simplified in that switchable high gain channel is removed. I have one of these running in my system right now that's just dead-bugged to the back of the faceplate. PCB layout is nearly completed, 

# Utility LFO
Design: Magic Smoke Electronics (http://electro-music.com/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Schematics.MagicSmokeLFODesignByTimServo)
Design alterations: None
NOT TESTED AT 12V YET
Required kludges: NOT TESTED YET
Notes: This is shrunk down to be a 1u module. There are power chain jumpers so that you can put 3 of them in a standard 3u tall panel, or you could build 1 and put it in a 1u tile. 

# Buffered Mult
Design: Michael Barton (http://www.bartonmusicalcircuits.com) 
Design alterations: None
Tested working 2019-02
Required kludges: None
Notes: This one is actually THT. It's a super simple but emminently useful utility module. The only tip here is to make sure you place J10 and J13 before the power header if you use a shrouded connector. Otherwise the plastic shroud will cover up the tip connections.
